Are you a UX/UI designer passionate about building something new that really matters?

We’re looking for a skilled Design team member to help us build enterprise-grade solutions for safe and secure software delivery for the on-premise and cloud environments. It is more than just creating mock-ups and pretty pictures, this is about making sure that using our solutions is a breeze and a great experience for end users.

We’re looking for someone who speaks both the developers’ and the designers’ languages and can bridge those two domains.

On any given day, you might handle anything from taking part in a Design Thinking workshop, researching new features by interviewing clients, to designing features and presenting them to developers and stakeholders.

**The areas you will focus on are:**

The Design team is working closely with the implementation cycle, and as a designer, you will be supporting each of the following stages:

*Discovery, planning, and research* – you will participate in the process of gathering insights and requirements, taking part in user or desk research, and facilitating or taking part in Design Thinking workshops.

*Design* – Participating in UI/UX design sessions and design critiques with the rest of the team; working on low to high-fidelity mockups (from pen & paper to Figma workflows), while creating new features or improving existing ones.

*Development* – You will work closely with our backend and frontend developers - they are also part of the design process. You will need to find solutions that are addressing the needs of our users and are feasible implementation-wise (design reusability, modularity, facilitation of code reuse).

*Testing* – Once developers are done with their work, you will be part of the review process where you test the application and check whether it has been implemented in accordance with the designs agreed upon. We also do holistic usability tests to ensure the whole environment is consistently user-friendly.

*Support* – You will participate in interviews with our users, to find out their pain points and needs. As a result, you will gather and formulate insights that will influence future designs.

**Attributes we care about:**

*User-oriented* – We are working in accordance with the Human Centered Design methodology where users are at the core of our job. If your focus is on users, you know how to perform interviews, and create astonishing test scenarios, then you are a right fit for us.

*Motivated* – You're excited to use your design skills and you want to learn new ones. You get things done. You do your job well, and you are a team player.

*Delivers* – You deliver. You want your prototype, mockup, hi-fi to be delivered to others today, rather than tomorrow.

*Problem Solver* – When you find a problem you don't know how to solve, you dive right in and you find the answer. When presented with a challenge, you immediately start to think of several solutions that you want to bounce off your teammates to select the right one.

*Details Oriented* – You can focus on the details while understanding and keeping in mind the bigger picture. You should care deeply about the details, especially those connected to users' needs.

*Design Savvy* – You know your stuff. You understand not only the how but also the why.

**Skills:**

We are looking for people with expertise in the following areas:

* Proficiency in design prototyping tools, like **Figma**, **Sketch**, or **Adobe XD**,
* Strong experience in use of research tools like **Mural** and **Airtable**
* Ability to create graphics in **Photoshop**, **Illustrator** or another program of your choosing,
* Experience in **UX Research**
* Experience in **Design Thinking**
* **Documented portfolio** (with at least 3-4 case studies with the project overview presented, your role and responsibilities, and the design process described),
* Ability to use **Github** and **Git** versioning systems to communicate with developers.

**Language Proficiency:**

We're working with English speaking clients, written and spoken English is required. If you need a requirement it's B2/C1.
You don't need to be able to discuss Shakespeare, but you need to understand Javadocs.

**When you join us, you might enjoy:**

* Company of like–minded individuals
* Working fully remote or from our office in Bydgoszcz or Warsaw
* Free coffee (at the office)
