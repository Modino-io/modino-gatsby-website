Ok, so you want in on a design & software engineering adventure?

***Great!***

We'll ask you to work on a project that will span various technologies and disciplines as this is how today's software engineering world is.

You'll get your hands into Product & Service design, DevOps, SysOps, SecOps, testing, and software engineering.

Team work is essential to complete the project, so you will need to communicate efficiently with your team mates.


The whole adventure (think of it as a long hackathon) will look more or less like this:

1. You'll get an introduction to the project scope and requirements,
2. It's up to you to slice up the work with your team mates and come up with a plan,
3. "He that asks, does not get lost"â€” you will have access to mentors, the [Smart Coders](https://www.smartcoders.xyz/), and [Shopa](https://shopa.eu) - design & strategy teams,
4. You're expected to finish the project and demo it at the end of the internship,
5. You project is to be completed by agreed upon deadline.

<br/>
Expect to work with the following technologies:
 - Containers,
 - Java and application servers,
 - Angular.io, and front-end related tech,
 - Source code management,
 - Visual design tools (UX / UI).

<br/>
We have a few requirements, so be sure to meet them before you apply:
 - You're studying software engineering, design (Human Centered Design approach) or a similar major,
 - You can dedicate two full months for this project,
 - You're not working full time anywhere else.

You can work remotely or at our [office](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nB2regUAWgeW5GaAA). It's up to you.
