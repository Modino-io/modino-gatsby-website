Are you passionate about building quality software? We're looking for engineers to help drive end–to–end engineering experience; the software we build is used by other developers (APIs) just as much as it is by end customers (definitely not APIs). This is about making sure that using our solutions is a breeze and a great experience.

You’ll be working on a project, that we've started a few years ago, but every year brings new challenges, and now we’re working on getting our product into the cloud.

We're looking for someone who can help us maintain the high quality of our software and drive it even higher. You're curious and always looking for new and more efficient ways to test software and enhance the overall process.

**The areas you will focus on are:**

*Designing and creating tests* – This will include everything from creating a test strategy, to writing automated tests, to writing scripts, to manual tests, to clicking around the front-end and finding what the developers missed,

*Writing integration tests for the API* –  Writing good integration tests of our public APIs puts both our clients and developers at ease. Clients can rely on a rock-solid API, and developers are free to refactor the underlying code without fear of breaking it. Your job will be to add integration tests, and work with developers to improve the API documentation.

*Writing end-to-end tests (E2E) for the UI* – Our build system automatically tests all of the features in the UI and with new feature new tests need to be created. Good E2E tests ensure that the desired user interactions are adhered to and maintained when new features are added.

**Attributes we care about:**

*Motivated* – You're excited to build new software. You're excited about quality of the software you help creating. You like finding new applications for your existing skills and learning new skills altogether. You get things done. You do your job well,

*Delivers* – You deliver. You want to get things done. You want the software shipped to your customers today, rather than tomorrow,
*Problem Solver* – You think outside the box. You break things. You're proud of it,

*Details Oriented* – You can focus on the details, while understanding and keeping in mind the bigger picture. You should care deeply about the details,

*Empathic* – you put yourself in the users' shoes. You are the bridge between developers and users, you advocate on their behalf,

*Technically Savvy* – You know your stuff. You're the authority about a particular technology. You understand not only the how, but also the why. You will need to solve real–world problems, and you need to have experience applying your knowledge to real, shipping products.

*Fast learner* – The technical environment and stack is changing with time and you will always have to learn new things to keep up. You want to use your knowledge and experience in your them.

**Basic requirements and skills:**

We're working with the following technologies, frameworks, and methodologies; we are looking for people who have the expertise in:
 * **Java, Shell scripting, Python, JavaScript, Typescript, nodejs, selenium, protractor, Postman, jasmine, rest-assured,**
 * **Ability to work with Linux OS,**
 * **Knowledge and prior experience with Kubernetes*** and ***Docker is a plus**
 * Experience with OpenShift is a plus,
