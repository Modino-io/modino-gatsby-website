Are you passionate about building quality software? We're looking for engineers to help drive end–to–end engineering experience; the software we build is used by other developers (APIs) just as much as it is by end customers (definitely not APIs). This is more than just writing code, this is about making sure that using our solutions is a breeze and a great experience.

We're looking for someone who can balance technical requirements and client needs to constantly drive improvement. On any given day you might handle anything from prototyping a new idea, adding new functionality to an existing solution, designing a new feature, writing technical documentation, or even jumping in to help a client solve a really tough problem.

**The areas you will focus on are:**

*Designing and creating back–end code* – This will include anything from creating new features and refactoring existing ones to fixing bugs. You will be responsible for the quality and completeness of the modules you oversee.

*Write end–to–end documentation for your code* – We believe that if the client can't figure out an answer, then we need to do better. Your job will be to always improve the documentation to make the experience better for our clients.

*Building APIs* – Software we build is very often used by other developers, hence they need to interact with it through some API. You'll be participating in designing those APIs and bringing them to life.

**Attributes we care about:**

*Motivated* – You're excited to build new software. You might prefer to tweak something on the front–end, but you enjoy back–end, scripting or tests just as much. You like finding new applications for your existing skills and learning new skills altogether. You get things done. You do your job well.

*Delivers* – You deliver. You want to get things done. You want your code shipped to your customers today, rather than tomorrow.

*Problem Solver* – When you find a problem you don't know how to solve, you dive right in and you find the answer. You immediately start to think of several solutions when presented with a challenge.

*Details Oriented* – You can focus on the details. You should care deeply about the details!

*Technically Savvy* – You know your stuff. You understand not only the how, but also the why. You need to have experience applying your knowledge to real, shipping products.

**Technical Skills:**

We are looking for people who have expertise with the following languages/frameworks. You will focus on one or two of these and should be able to go deep:

* Java
* Java EE
* Knowledge of RESTful interfaces
* Experience with Agile Software Development Methodology
* Python, Go, Swift; you don't care about the tool — you've done some work in many of them
* Javascript frameworks would be nice, too.

**Language Proficiency:**

We're working with English speaking clients. Written and spoken English is required.

**When you join us, you might enjoy:**

* Flexible working hours
* Competitive compensation
* Private health insurance
* Company of like–minded individuals
* Working fully remote or from our office in Bydgoszcz or Warsaw
* Free coffee (at the office)
* A MacBook Pro, and a 4k monitor
* and a standing desk (at the office)!

**Important details:**

* Profile: senior / expert
* Contract type: **B2B**
* Recruitment process: online, and final stage in real life
* Start: **ASAP**
* Work profile: mainly new features
* Length of contact: continuous
* Payed vacation: no
