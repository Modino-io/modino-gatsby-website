Are you passionate about building quality software? We’re looking for skilled engineers to help us build a solution for safe and secure software delivery for the on-premise and cloud environments. This is more than just writing code, this is about making sure that using our solutions is a breeze and a great experience.

You’ll be working on a project, that we've started a few years ago, but every year brings new challenges, and now we’re working on getting our product into the cloud.

We’re looking for someone who has a deep understanding of containerization technologies and knows the difference between k8s and Docker, has already made 1000 mistakes, and knows how to recover from a disaster.

*Fast learner* –  The technical environment and stack is changing with time and you will always have to learn new things to keep up.
