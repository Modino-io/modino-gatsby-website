        </h3>
        <p>
          We occasionally work with third parties who support us with
          services: Google Analytics tracking technologies. We use the Google
          Analytics tool provided by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway,
          Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. We carry out these activities based on
          our legitimate interest in creating statistics and analyzing them in
          order to optimize the website. In order to use Google Analytics, we
          have implemented a special Google Analytics tracking code in the
          code of the website. The tracking code uses cookies from Google LLC
          concerning the Google Analytics service. You can block the Google
          Analytics tracking code at any time by installing a browser add-on
          provided by Google. Google Analytics automatically collects
          information about your use of the website. The information collected
          in this way is usually transmitted to and stored on Google servers,
          which may be located around the world. Due to the IP address
          anonymisation activated by us, your IP address is truncated before
          being passed on. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address
          transmitted to Google's servers and shortened there. The anonymised
          IP address transmitted by your browser within the scope of Google
          Analytics is generally not combined with other Google data. We would
          like to emphasize that we do not collect any data within the scope
          of Google Analytics that would allow you to be identified.
          Therefore, the data collected within the framework of Google
          Analytics does not have the character of personal data for us. The
          information we have access to as part of Google Analytics is in
          particular:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>your operating system and browser,</li>
          <li>pages you view,</li>
          <li>the time you spend on the website and on individual pages,</li>
          <li>transitions between pages,</li>
          <li>the source you came to our site from,</li>
          <li>your approximate location, limited to your locality.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Google Analytics and Google Analytics 360 services have been
          certified to the independent security standard ISO 27001. ISO 27001
          is one of the most widely recognised standards in the world and
          certifies that the systems operating Google Analytics and Google
          Analytics 360 meet the relevant requirements. If you are interested
          in the details related to Google's use of data from sites and
          applications that use Google services, we encourage you to read this
          information. We review these third-party vendors rigorously to
          ensure they meet our privacy standards and limit the data they can
          access to only what is necessary for them to perform their
          contracted tasks.
