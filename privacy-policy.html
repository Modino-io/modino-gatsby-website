          <p>
            We occasionally work with third parties who support us with
            services: Google Analytics tracking technologies. We use the Google
            Analytics tool provided by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway,
            Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. We carry out these activities based on
            our legitimate interest in creating statistics and analyzing them in
            order to optimize the website. In order to use Google Analytics, we
            have implemented a special Google Analytics tracking code in the
            code of the website. The tracking code uses cookies from Google LLC
            concerning the Google Analytics service. You can block the Google
            Analytics tracking code at any time by installing a browser add-on
            provided by Google. Google Analytics automatically collects
            information about your use of the website. The information collected
            in this way is usually transmitted to and stored on Google servers,
            which may be located around the world. Due to the IP address
            anonymisation activated by us, your IP address is truncated before
            being passed on. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address
            transmitted to Google's servers and shortened there. The anonymised
            IP address transmitted by your browser within the scope of Google
            Analytics is generally not combined with other Google data. We would
            like to emphasize that we do not collect any data within the scope
            of Google Analytics that would allow you to be identified.
            Therefore, the data collected within the framework of Google
            Analytics does not have the character of personal data for us. The
            information we have access to as part of Google Analytics is in
            particular:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>your operating system and browser,</li>
            <li>pages you view,</li>
            <li>the time you spend on the website and on individual pages,</li>
            <li>transitions between pages,</li>
            <li>the source you came to our site from,</li>
            <li>your approximate location, limited to your locality.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Google Analytics and Google Analytics 360 services have been
            certified to the independent security standard ISO 27001. ISO 27001
            is one of the most widely recognised standards in the world and
            certifies that the systems operating Google Analytics and Google
            Analytics 360 meet the relevant requirements. If you are interested
            in the details related to Google's use of data from sites and
            applications that use Google services, we encourage you to read this
            information. We review these third-party vendors rigorously to
            ensure they meet our privacy standards and limit the data they can
            access to only what is necessary for them to perform their
            contracted tasks.
